# Middle Finger Giver

This repo contains the contract logic for the Middle Finger Giver Web3 App! I'm using Solidity and JS for the deploy and run files, taking advantage of hardhat and ethers for the contract handling.

This is a project made with a reference from [Buildspace](https://t.co/bJftHYdTdW?amp=1).
Test it [here](https://middle-finger-giver.nestorolivaresh.repl.co/)
